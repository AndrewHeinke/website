Making videos has always been a passion of mine. Initially I began creating fun content that I could share with my friends and family.

As I transitioned into the working world I wanted to figure out a way I could leverage the power of video in my everyday job. I began recording my screen and voice while I showcased our React infrastructure components and utilities. This lead to the creation of several video tutorial playlists that are now used to onboard new developers and give designers insights into the basics of how the infrastructure works. These videos are extremely valuable due to our teams limited developer resources.

Videos allow me to multiply my time helping others without taking up my time. While I am unable to publicly share the videos I made for work, I can share some I made for fun below.
