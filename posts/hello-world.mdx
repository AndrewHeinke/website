This is an example post, with a [link](https://nextjs.org) and a React component:

## Hello

The title and description are pulled from the MDX file and processed using `gray-matter`. Additionally, links are rendered using a custom component passed to `next-mdx-remote`.

> Note ðŸš¨: You need to use forwardRef from chakra-ui not react.

```tsx live=false
import { forwardRef, Box, BoxProps } from "@chakra-ui/react";

const Card = forwardRef<BoxProps, "div">((props, ref) => (
  <Box px="4" py="5" rounded="sm" shadow="lg" ref={ref} {...props} />
));
```
